## LLM-Based Tourist Recommendations

Tourist recommendations are generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) called Gemini. The agent provides personalized itineraries, travel tips, and cultural advice based on user queries, without relying on external APIs for this feature.

## API Keys

- **Google API Key:** Required for Gemini LLM access. Prompted at runtime if not set in environment variables.
- **Aladhan API:** Used for prayer times (no key required for public endpoints).

## Usage

Run the agent with:
```bash
python smart_uae_agent.py
```
You will be prompted for your Google API key if not already set.
